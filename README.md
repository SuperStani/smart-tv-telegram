# smart-tv-telegram
wtf?
- this bot permit to stream document from telegram over http
- this bot permit to control upnp devices for stream videos
- this bot is opensource

# now with chromecast support
- can enable it on config.json on chromecast_support
- it's experimental, not have a physical device for real life test

# how-to setup
- install python deps from requirement.txt
- rename config.json.example to config.json
- edit config.json, change token, ip address and admin list

# this is a fork?
yes but no, original idea:
